# Bubble-Game
When the game starts, the timer counts down from 60 seconds. The player must click on bubbles with the number matching the target number displayed in the "Hit" box. If the correct bubble is clicked, the score increases and new bubbles are generated. The game ends when the timer reaches 0, displaying "Game Over".
